This is the code for an alarm clock I'm building. It's a raspberry pi with a custom soldered macropad as an input device and will talk to a Sonos speaker as the audio output device. 

The whole thing is overkill, but this project is supposed to be a healthy mix of "using what I know" and "learning new things."

Note to self: Starting the program on boot: https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/

Also for the record, I haven't written any python since middle school, so there's bound to be some hacky and non-optimal code in here. Don't judge me too hard.
